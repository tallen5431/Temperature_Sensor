Temperature Sensor Hub

A tiny hub for ESP32 + DS18B20 “probes.” It does three things:

Ingests temperature readings via REST and appends to temperature_log.csv.

Serves a live dashboard (Dash/Plotly + Bootstrap) with a nicer temperature graph and latest reading.

Discovers and auto-provisions probes over mDNS/DNS-SD and watches for an unprovisioned probe’s SoftAP SSID TempSensor to guide first-time setup.

What “auto-provision” means

When a probe is found on your LAN via mDNS as _temps-probe._tcp.local., the hub can POST to the probe’s /provision endpoint with your hub URL and interval. That sets the probe to push to http://<hub>:8088/api/ingest automatically.
